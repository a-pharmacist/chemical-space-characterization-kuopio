# Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks organized by folders within the `main` directory. Each folder is self-contained and follows a standardized structure to ensure script reproducibility and proper output management.

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder under `main` includes the following components:

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the data analysis or processing script.
- `input_file/`: This folder contains all the input files required for the notebook to run. These files should be loaded within the notebook.
- `output_file/`: This folder is used to store all output files generated during the execution of the notebook.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a subfolder within the `main` directory.
2. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Ensure that all files from the `input_file/` folder are available and correctly referenced in the notebook.
4. Run all cells in the notebook. Output files will be automatically generated.
